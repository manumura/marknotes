# What is this?
A simple static blog built with Golang + HTMX + Tailwind CSS. 
Currently has very little features (only posting article, server-side markdown rendering, and GitHub OAuth login), but I want to expand it more as I needed more functionality. 

## Getting Started
Create `.env` file (see `env.sample`), then run `make local-setup` and `make run`. That's it :)
